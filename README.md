### Zusammen - All Xcode Extensions Together in One Place.

- Xcode extensions are to be installed manually and Alcatraz does not work anymore.
- Some extensions are now available on App Store and some need to be build manually.
- Discovering of extensions is hard, one has to search for exact problems to find solutions, sometimes one might not know what they are looking for.

### Goals

- [ ] Collect all the extensions out there and store their information.
- [ ] Make it easy to upload new extensions into the list.
- [ ] Make installation process easy - App store download, downloading source and building it, download from releases and other sources.
